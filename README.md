# Hearthstone_Implementation
Rogue and Druid Decks

This repository contains code for a Python implementation of Hearthstone, a collectible card game developed by Blizzard. The website for the game is here: https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/


The decks for Rogue and Druid are found here: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Basic_deck


Hearthstone is a turn-based card game where two opposing players start with 30 health points. They take turns playing spells and minions to get their opponent to 0 health points.
The code in this repository creates a text-based version of the game, printing out the details of the cards and asking the players to input which cards they want to play.
